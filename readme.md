This document was created for a workshop during the [Let's talk science](http://letstalkscience.be/) event 2015. 


## Outline

1. Present your research topic

2. [Scientometrics](#anchor1)
	- Introduction
	- Group discussions
		- In my field of research, what do I know about:
			- the journal impact factors
			- the researchers h-index
		- What are the limitations of
			- impact factor
			- h-index
			- altmetrics
	- Sharing and conclusions
	
3. [Publish everything](#anchor2)
	- Group discussions
		- What type of scientific product do I produce?
		- How can I valorise my production (what do I already do?)
	- Sharing
	- Tools presentations
	- In practice
	
4. [Advertise yourself](#anchor3)	
	
## [Scientometrics](id:anchor1)

Wikipedia:

> Scientometrics is the study of measuring and analysing science, technology and innovation. Major research issues include the measurement of impact, reference sets of articles to investigate the impact of journals and institutes, understanding of scientific citations, mapping scientific fields and the production of indicators for use in policy and management contexts

Many indicators exits. We will only discuss the principal onces. For more info about other indicators, see:

- Google Scholar metrics [https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues]()
- h-index definition [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index]()
- impact factor definition [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor]()

### Journal level: Impact factor


#### Definition

Wikipedia: 

> The impact factor (IF) of an academic journal is a measure reflecting the average number of citations to recent articles published in that journal.

$$IF = {n_{citations} \over n_{papers}}$$

#### Source
- ISI Journal Citation Report
	- [http://apps.webofknowledge.com/]()
	- [http://www.citefactor.org/journal-impact-factor-list-2014.html]()

#### Critics


- Influenced by
	- trendiness
	- readership
	- publicity
	- field
	- auto-citations
	- journal policy
- Average of all papers
	- potential influence of *start* article
	- higher for reviews

### Researcher level: h-index

#### Definition

> A scientist has index h if h of his/her n papers have at least h citations each, and the other (n âˆ’ h) papers have no more than h citations each.


![h-index computations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaumelobet/science_valorisation/master/images/figure2.png)

#### Source

- Scopus [http://www.scopus.com/]()
- Google Scholar [https://scholar.google.com]()

#### Critics

- include both the number of papers and the number of citations
	- one good paper is not enough
	- many bad papers are not enough
	- quality and quantity
	
- Influenced by
	- age
	- trendiness
	- field
	- auto-citations

- Not influenced by
	- author contribution

### Article level: Altmetrics


#### Definition

Wikipedia:

> altmetrics are non-traditional metrics proposed as an alternative to more traditional citation impact metrics, such as impact factor and h-index.

Tracks impact in social media and web 2.0 platforms, such as:

- Twitter
- Mendeley
- Facebook
- Blogs
- figshare
- github
- pubmed
- ...
- ...

- Plum analytics [http://www.plumanalytics.com/]()
- ImpactStory [http://www.impactstory.org]()

#### Drawbacks

- Influenced by
	- trendiness
	- buzz
	- author existing network

- Not (necessarily) influenced by
	- scientific quality

## [Publish everything](id:anchor2)


### Science is not just about publishing papers

As scientists, we have a lot of different skills, occupations or duties. Peer-review papers are only one way to valorise these.

### The networks' network

Maintaining a profile on multiple platforms can take a lot of time. Fortunately, most of the tools and platforms are interconnected. Use these interconnections to stay easily up to-date.
