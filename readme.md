## [Scientometrics](id:anchor1)

Wikipedia:

> Scientometrics is the study of measuring and analysing science, technology and innovation. Major research issues include the measurement of impact, reference sets of articles to investigate the impact of journals and institutes, understanding of scientific citations, mapping scientific fields and the production of indicators for use in policy and management contexts

Many indicators exits. We will only discuss the principal onces. For more info about other indicators, see:

- Google Scholar metrics [https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues]()
- h-index definition [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index]()
- impact factor definition [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor]()

### Journal level: Impact factor


#### Definition

Wikipedia: 

> The impact factor (IF) of an academic journal is a measure reflecting the average number of citations to recent articles published in that journal.

$$IF = {n_{citations} \over n_{papers}}$$

#### Source
- ISI Journal Citation Report
	- [http://apps.webofknowledge.com/]()
	- [http://www.citefactor.org/journal-impact-factor-list-2014.html]()

#### Critics


- Influenced by
	- trendiness
	- readership
	- publicity
	- field
	- auto-citations
	- journal policy
- Average of all papers
	- potential influence of *start* article
	- higher for reviews


----

### Researcher level: h-index

#### Definition

> A scientist has index h if h of his/her n papers have at least h citations each, and the other (n âˆ’ h) papers have no more than h citations each.


![h-index computations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaumelobet/science_valorisation/master/images/figure2.png)

#### Source

- Scopus [http://www.scopus.com/]()
- Google Scholar [https://scholar.google.com]()

#### Critics

- include both the number of papers and the number of citations
	- one good paper is not enough
	- many bad papers are not enough
	- quality and quantity
	
- Influenced by
	- age
	- trendiness
	- field
	- auto-citations

- Not influenced by
	- author contribution
	 


----

### Article level: Altmetrics


#### Definition

Wikipedia:

> altmetrics are non-traditional metrics proposed as an alternative to more traditional citation impact metrics, such as impact factor and h-index.

Tracks impact in social media and web 2.0 platforms, such as:

- Twitter
- Mendeley
- Facebook
- Blogs
- figshare
- github
- pubmed
- YouTube, Vimeo
- ...
- ...

- Plum analytics [http://www.plumanalytics.com/]()
- ImpactStory [http://www.impactstory.org]()

#### Drawbacks

- Influenced by
	- trendiness
	- buzz
	- author existing network

- Not (necessarily) influenced by
	- scientific quality

## [Publish everything](id:anchor2)


### Science is not just about publishing papers

As scientists, we have a lot of different skills, occupations or duties. Peer-review papers are only one way to valorise these. 

![The scientific pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaumelobet/science_valorisation/master/images/figure4.png)


#### Datasets

Acquiring dataset is a long and (sometime) expensive experience. Most of the time, you will not even use it at its maximal capacity. Sharing a dataset is a good way to valorise it further and enable additional analysis by the community.

- figshare [http://figshare.com/]()
- Dryad [http://datadryad.org/]()
- ...

#### Reading papers

The most basic scientific activity is reading paper. We all do it. We do it for ourself, to stay up to-date in our field, to learn about a new topic, etc. Sometimes, we even find flaws or mistakes in published papers. There is no reason we should not be able to share this reading experience...

- Mendeley [https://www.mendeley.com/]()
- Zotero [https://www.zotero.org/]()
- PubPeer  [https://pubpeer.com/]()
- Pubmed Commons [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedcommons/]()
- ...

#### Code

Almost any analysis or plot required some level of coding. While some of it is trivial and easy to reproduce, some are more complexe. Sometimes, we spend days on a specific analysis, a particular graph. Sharing this experience will help the people who want to reproduce what you have done.

If you are developing software tools, or algorithms, its is even more important to share your code. It is the foundation of your work, what you can get credit for.

Sharing your code is also perfect way to work in team, build new collaborations and keep track of your work (version tracking).

- Github [http://www.github.com]()
- Sourceforge [http://www.sourceforge.net]()
- Bitbucket [https://bitbucket.org/]()
- ...


#### Reviewing

Peer-reviewing is one of the foundation of academic publishing. The whole publishing system is based on the **voluntary** contribution of the scientific community. In addition, proper reviewing take some time, especially for young researchers. As such, reviewing activities should be valorised.

- Publons [https://publons.com/]()

#### Posters, presentations

- figshare [http://figshare.com/]()
- Slideshare [www.slideshare.net]()
- f1000 [http://f1000.com/posters]()

#### Lab life

Writing a blog 	about your research is good for several reasons. It make you think about what you are doing and force you to structure your mind. It is also an excellent practice for writing paper. Quoting (from memory...) [Tobias Baskin](https://www.cpib.ac.uk/lab-fab/):

> When you give a child a violin for the first time, you do not expect him to play well. The same goes for writing. Practicing is the key.

So, go ahead and blog about your lab!

- Blogging
	- Wordpress [http://wordpress.com/]()
	- Blogger [http://www.blogger.com]()
	- Tumblr [http://tumblr.com/]()
	- Medium [https://medium.com/]()	


#### Pre-prints

Before putting a pre-print of your article, do not forget to check the publishing policy of the target journal. Some do not accept to publish research that has been posted on a pre-print server.

- arXiv [http://arxiv.org/]()
- bioRXiv [http://biorxiv.org/]()
- PeerJ pre-prints [https://peerj.com/preprints/]()


#### Expertise

As a scientist, you have a unique expertise in, at least, on domain. You can use to web to share it!

- Stack Exchange [http://www.stackexchange.com]()
- ResearchGate [http://www.researchgate.net]()





## [Advertise yourself](id:anchor3)


- Type you name in Google (this is most likely what future employers will do)
- See the first results
- Is this what you want other people to see about you?
- Not really?
- Then it is time to **do something about it**


### Get your identifier

### Social networks

Facebook, but for scientists!

- Generalist: 
	- LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/]()
- Specialised
	- ResearchGate [http://www.researchgate.net]()
	- Academia.edu [https://www.academia.edu/]() 

These networks can be used to connect with your colleagues, display your publications and access other's, interact with other scientists. 


### ImpactStory

	DISCLAIMER: I am an ImpactStory adviser since 2013. 
	That means I got three free t-shirts and free stickers.

> Discover and share how your research is read, cited, tweeted, bookmarked, and more. 

ImpactStory is a **paid service** (free to try) that gathers all your scientific production in one place and computed related altmetrics. These metrics are put into context (related to your fields, the platform, ...). 

Update of your profile can be automated by connecting it to ORCID, Scopus, Twitter, ....

![ImpactStory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaumelobet/science_valorisation/master/images/figure5.png)



Once your profile is fully setup, you can export it to JSON, CSV or as a formatted markdown CV ([http://impact.guillaumelobet.be/]())











## The networks' network

Maintaining profiles on multiple platforms can take a lot of time. Fortunately, most of the tools and platforms are interconnected. Use these interconnections to stay easily up to-date.
