Major research issues include the measurement of impact, reference sets of articles to investigate the impact of journals and institutes, understanding of scientific citations, mapping scientific fields and the production of indicators for use in policy and management contexts\r\n\r\nMany indicators exits. We will only discuss the principal onces.

Peer-review papers are only one way to valorise these. \r\n\r\n![The scientific pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaumelobet/science_valorisation/master/images/figure4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Datasets\r\n\r\nAcquiring dataset is a long and (sometime) expensive experience. Most of the time, you will not even use it at its maximal capacity. Sharing a dataset is a good way to valorise it further and enable additional analysis by the community.\r\n\r\n- figshare [http://figshare.com/]()\r\n- Dryad [http://datadryad.org/]()\r\n- ...\r\n\r\n#### Reading papers\r\n\r\nThe most basic scientific activity is reading paper. We all do it. We do it for ourself, to stay up to-date in our field, to learn about a new topic, etc. Sometimes, we even find flaws or mistakes in published papers. There is no reason we should not be able to share this reading experience...\r\n\r\n- Mendeley [https://www.mendeley.com/]()\r\n- Zotero [https://www.zotero.org/]()\r\n- PubPeer  [https://pubpeer.com/]()\r\n- Pubmed Commons [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedcommons/]()\r\n- ...\r\n\r\n#### Code\r\n\r\nAlmost any analysis or plot required some level of coding. While some of it is trivial and easy to reproduce, some are more complexe. Sometimes, we spend days on a specific analysis, a particular graph. Sharing this experience will help the people who want to reproduce what you have done.\r\n\r\nIf you are developing software tools, or algorithms, its is even more important to share your code. It is the foundation of your work, what you can get credit for.\r\n\r\nSharing your code is also perfect way to work in team, build new collaborations and keep track of your work (version tracking).\r\n\r\n- Github [http://www.github.com]()\r\n- Sourceforge [http://www.sourceforge.net]()\r\n- Bitbucket [https://bitbucket.org/]()\r\n- ...\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Reviewing\r\n\r\nPeer-reviewing is one of the foundation of academic publishing. The whole publishing system is based on the **voluntary** contribution of the scientific community. In addition, proper reviewing take some time, especially for young researchers. As such, reviewing activities should be valorised.\r\n\r\n- Publons [https://publons.com/]()\r\n\r\n#### Posters, presentations\r\n\r\n- figshare [http://figshare.com/]()\r\n- Slideshare [www.slideshare.net]()\r\n- f1000 [http://f1000.com/posters]()\r\n\r\n#### Lab life\r\n\r\nWriting a blog \tabout your research is good for several reasons. It make you think about what you are doing and force you to structure your mind. It is also an excellent practice for writing paper. Quoting (from memory...) [Tobias Baskin](https://www.cpib.ac.uk/lab-fab/):\r\n\r\n> When you give a child a violin for the first time, you do not expect him to play well. The same goes for writing. Practicing is the key.\r\n\r\nSo, go ahead and blog about your lab!\r\n\r\n- Blogging\r\n\t- Wordpress [http://wordpress.com/]()\r\n\t- Blogger [http://www.blogger.com]()\r\n\t- Tumblr [http://tumblr.com/]()\r\n\t- Medium [https://medium.com/]()\t\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Pre-prints\r\n\r\nBefore putting a pre-print of your article, do not forget to check the publishing policy of the target journal. Some do not accept to publish research that has been posted on a pre-print server.\r\n\r\n- arXiv [http://arxiv.org/]()\r\n- bioRXiv [http://biorxiv.org/]()\r\n- PeerJ pre-prints [https://peerj.com/preprints/]()\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Expertise\r\n\r\nAs a scientist, you have a unique expertise in, at least, on domain. You can use to web to share it!\r\n\r\n- Stack Exchange [http://www.stackexchange.com]()\r\n- ResearchGate [http://www.researchgate.net]()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Advertise yourself](id:anchor3)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Type you name in Google (this is most likely what future employers will do)\r\n- See the first results\r\n- Is this what you want other people to see about you?\r\n- Not really?\r\n- Then it is time to **do something about it**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Get your identifier\r\n\r\nMany scientists have homonyms, sometime in the same community. It is important to be able to distinguish them. Sometime, you also change name during your career. Both reason calls for a unique way to identify yourself in the research community. \r\n\r\n**ORCID** ([http://orcid.org/]()) is a service allowing researcher to claim a unique identifier. This identifier can be use in other services, such as publishers, online platforms, ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Social networks\r\n\r\nFacebook, but for scientists!\r\n\r\n- Generalist: \r\n\t- LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/]()\r\n- Specialised\r\n\t- ResearchGate [http://www.researchgate.net]()\r\n\t- Academia.edu [https://www.academia.edu/]() \r\n\r\nThese networks can be used to connect with your colleagues, display your publications and access other's, interact with other scientists. \r\n\r\n\r\n### ImpactStory\r\n\r\n\tDISCLAIMER: I am an ImpactStory adviser since 2013. \r\n\tThat means I got three free t-shirts and free stickers.\r\n\r\n> Discover and share how your research is read, cited, tweeted, bookmarked, and more. \r\n\r\nImpactStory is a **paid service** (free to try) that gathers all your scientific production in one place and computed related altmetrics. These metrics are put into context (related to your fields, the platform, ...). \r\n\r\nUpdate of your profile can be automated by connecting it to ORCID, Scopus, Twitter, ....\r\n\r\n![ImpactStory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaumelobet/science_valorisation/master/images/figure5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce your profile is fully setup, you can export it to JSON, CSV or as a formatted markdown CV ([http://impact.guillaumelobet.be/]())\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Twitter\r\n\r\nTwitter can be used in multiple ways in the scientific community. It can be used for:\r\n\r\n- stay up to date with the literature (follow journals)\r\n- stay up to date with there scientists work (follow colleagues)\r\n- outreach to the public\r\n\r\n\r\n- Tweet your Science [http://www.tweetyourscience.com/]()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## The networks' network\r\n\r\nMaintaining profiles on multiple platforms can take a lot of time. Fortunately, most of the tools and platforms are interconnected. Use these interconnections to stay easily up to-date.\r\n\r\n\r\n![The networks' network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaumelobet/science_valorisation/master/images/figure6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Further reading\r\n\r\n- Impact challenge [http://blog.impactstory.org/research-impact-challenge-ebook/]()\r\n- Osterrieder, A.
